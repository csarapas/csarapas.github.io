									<h2>About Dr. Sarapas</h2>
									<p>As a neuropsychologist, I help clients understand their thinking abilities and how to better translate these into success in work, school, and other areas of life. I strive to give clients, their families, and healthcare providers an understanding not simply of “what’s wrong,” but just as importantly, “what’s next.” My goal for every assessment is to give clients concrete, achievable steps to meet their goals and improve quality of life.</p>
									<p>I am a licensed clinical psychologist and a staff neuropsychologist at Mount Auburn Hospital. I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois at Chicago and completed clinical training at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, the Baltimore VA Medical Center, and Cambridge Health Alliance. I was previously a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. My CV is available <a href="Sarapas_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

									<h2>About Neuropsychological Assessment</h2>
									<p>Neuropsychological assessment starts with a detailed interview to better understand you, your background, and your concerns. We will then work to test different thinking abilities, such as attention, learning, memory, language, visual skills, reasoning, and problem-solving. Depending on the assessment question, tests of emotional functioning, personality, or social skills may also be given. The tests are done with pencil and paper or on the computer. When testing is finished, we will discuss the results and tailored recommendations for addressing areas of difficulty in your life and better meeting your goals. Results and recommendations are summarized in a written report, which can be shared with other healthcare providers with your permission. The assessment and feedback usually take place across three appointments.</p>

									<h2>Areas Assessed</h2>
									<p>My practice serves adults with concerns in several areas.</p>
										<h3>Memory Loss, Dementia, and Alzheimer's disease</h3>
										<p>Neuropsychological assessment can distinguish between early stages of dementia, normal aging, and other conditions such as depression. If dementia is present, assessment can clarify areas where more support is needed, which treatments may be most helpful, and whether memory and thinking problems are likely to worsen in the future. I provide clients and their families detailed recommendations for preserving the client's dignity and quality of life while ensuring safety and health. I am available for additional follow-up meetings with clients and families to help adjust to a diagnosis, improve communication, and plan for the future.</p>
										<h3>Learning and Attention Difficulties</h3>
										<p>I work with adults of all ages to better understand problems with learning or work performance, including ADHD and learning disabilities. My goals for these assessments are to offer both support and empowerment. Based on the client's test results, I recommend appropriate accommodations for school, work, or standardized tests (e.g., GRE, MCAT, or LSAT). I also recommend tools, resources, and strategies that the client can use to maximize their attention, learning, and productivity.</p>
										<h3>Medical and Mental Health Conditions</h3>
										<p>Thinking abilities can be affected by many health conditions, ranging from from traumatic brain injury, stroke, and diabetes to depression and PTSD. In addition to identifying these thinking difficulties, neuropsychological assessment can point to treatments and strategies to improve thinking and overall quality of life, based on each client's unique weaknesses and strengths.</p>
										<h3>Psychological and Personality Testing</h3>
										<p>Psychological assessment focuses on understanding clients' unique ways of seeing the world, connecting with other people, coping with adversity, and pursuing their values. For clients in psychotherapy, assessment can bring treatment goals into sharper focus, suggest treatment approaches most likely to be helpful, and help identify and avoid potential roadblocks.</p>
