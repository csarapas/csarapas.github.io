									<h2>About Dr. Sarapas</h2>
									<p>I am a licensed clinical psychologist and a staff neuropsychologist at Mount Auburn Hospital. I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois at Chicago and completed clinical training at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, the Baltimore VA Medical Center, and Cambridge Health Alliance. I was previously a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. My CV is available <a href="Sarapas_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
									<p>As a neuropsychologist, I help clients understand their thinking abilities and how to better translate these into success in school, work, and life. My goal for every assessment is to give clients concrete, useful, and achievable steps to meet their goals and improve quality of life. I strive to give clients, families, and health providers an understanding not simply of “what’s wrong,” but just as importantly, “what’s next,” including strategies and resources tailored to the client’s unique needs, abilities, and circumstances.</p>

									<h2>About Neuropsychological Assessment</h2>
									<p>Neuropsychological assessment starts with a detailed interview to better understand you, your background, and your concerns. We will then work to test different thinking abilities, such as attention, learning, memory, language, visual skills, reasoning, and problem-solving. Depending on the assessment question, tests of emotional functioning, personality, or social skills may also be given. The tests are done with pencil and paper or on the computer. We will discuss the test results in detail, including diagnosis (if any), areas of strength and weakness and how these relate to your concerns, and recommendations to address areas of difficulty and support you in meeting your goals. Results and recommendations are also summarized in a written report, which can be shared with other healthcare providers with your permission.</p>

									<h2>Areas Assessed</h2>
									<p>My practice serves clients with concerns in several areas.</p>
										<h3>Memory Loss, Dementia, and Alzheimer's disease</h3>
										<p>For clients and family members concerned about memory changes, neuropsychological assessment can distinguish between early stages of dementia, other conditions affecting memory (such as depression), and normal memory lapses due to aging. If dementia is present, assessment can also reveal areas of intact ability and where more support is needed, which treatments may be most helpful, and whether memory problems are likely to worsen in the future. I offer clients and their families detailed recommendations including resources available in the community, how to maximize independence while protecting safety and health, and planning for the future. I am available for follow-up meetings with clients and families to help adjust to a diagnosis, improve communication, and manage problematic behavior.</p>
										<h3>Learning and Attention Difficulties</h3>
										<p>My practice focuses on two primary areas: assessing adults with concern for Phasellus convallis elit id ullamcorper pulvinar. Duis aliquam turpis mauris, eu ultricies erat malesuada quis. Aliquam dapibus.</p>
										<h3>Medical and Mental Health Conditions</h3>
