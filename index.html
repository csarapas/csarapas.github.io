									<h2>About Dr. Sarapas</h2>
									<p>I am a licensed clinical psychologist and a staff neuropsychologist at Mount Auburn Hospital. I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois at Chicago and completed clinical training at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System, the Baltimore VA Medical Center, and Cambridge Health Alliance. I was previously a clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School. My CV is available <a href="Sarapas_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
									<p>As a neuropsychologist, I help clients understand their thinking abilities and how to better translate these into success in work, school, and other areas of life. I strive to give clients, their families, and healthcare providers an understanding not simply of “what’s wrong,” but just as importantly, “what’s next.” My goal for every assessment is to give clients concrete, achievable steps to meet their goals and improve quality of life.</p>

									<h2>About Neuropsychological Assessment</h2>
									<p>Neuropsychological assessment starts with a detailed interview to better understand you, your background, and your concerns. We will then work to test different thinking abilities, such as attention, learning, memory, language, visual skills, reasoning, and problem-solving. Depending on the assessment question, tests of emotional functioning, personality, or social skills may also be given. The tests are done with pencil and paper or on the computer. We will discuss the test results in detail, including areas of strength and weakness and any diagnoses. We will also discuss recommendations based on your test results for addressing areas of difficulty in your life and support you in meeting your goals. Results and recommendations are also summarized in a written report, which can be shared with other healthcare providers with your permission.</p>

										<h2>Areas Assessed</h2>
										<h3>Memory Loss, Dementia, and Alzheimer's disease</h3>
										<p>Neuropsychological assessment can distinguish between early stages of dementia, normal aging, and other conditions such as depression. If dementia is present, assessment can clarify areas where more support is needed, which treatments may be most helpful, and whether memory and thinking problems are likely to worsen in the future. I provide clients and their families detailed recommendations for preserving the client's dignity and quality of life while ensuring safety and health. I am available for additional follow-up meetings with clients and families to help adjust to a diagnosis, improve communication, and plan for the future.</p>

										<h3>Learning and Attention Difficulties</h3>
										<p>I work with adults of all ages to better understand problems with learning or work performance, including ADHD and learning disabilities. My goals for these assessments are to offer both support and empowerment. Based on the client's test results, I recommend appropriate accommodations for school, work, or standardized tests (e.g., GRE, MCAT, or LSAT). I also recommend tools, resources, and strategies that the client can use to maximize their attention, learning, and productivity.</p>

										<h3>Medical and Mental Health Conditions</h3>
										<p>Thinking abilities are often affected in many health conditions, from traumatic brain injury and stroke to diabetes and heart disease to depression and PTSD. In addition to identifying these thinking difficulties, neuropsychological assessment can point to treatments and strategies to improve thinking and overall quality of life, based on each client's unique weaknesses and strengths.</p>
